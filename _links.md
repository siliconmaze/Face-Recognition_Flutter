This has some interesting ideas:

Flutter pluginf or Azure Cognitive Services:
https://pub.dev/packages/cognitive_services

Livneess checking:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/face-api-how-to-topics/how-to-use-headpose

In a nutshell for Fujitsu, as this time we are limited to SDKs from suppliers. 

SAFR gives us facial regonition and linvess cheks using smile, frown, indifference. unless we can evaluate another vendor we are limted with options.

It is possible that we use Face++ but we cannot use this going forward, and I am unsure of licensing?
